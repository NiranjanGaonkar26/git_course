Git is a ==Distributed Version Control== system

3 types of Version Control System (VCS)
---
1. Local VCS: All versions of the project are present on the local machine only.
2. Central VCS: All versions of the project are present on a centralized server, so a person should first get a copy of the current version from the central system, makes changes and commits the changes to the central system. 
		drawback: What if the central system crashes?, in each of the collaborators system, the current version of the project might be there, but the entire history of the project(I., all the versions of the project will not be there.)
1. Distributed VCS: The **entire history of the project** will not be there in the central repository, but will also be **there in each of the collaborators systems.**

Examples of central(i.e, remote) repositories: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket
