1. git clone project_url_or_ssh_url: this command clones a remote repo (i.e say a project in Github) to your local git repo.
	==Note:==
	 i. if you are using the remote repo URL, then while pushing you may have to login each time. But if you have established a connection using ssh, then this will not be required.
	 ii. You may clone any remote repo (i.e, any project on github), but only authorized users(i.e, collaborators) are allowed to push to the remote repo.
